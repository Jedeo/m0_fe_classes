# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
-this by far was the must challenging assignment I worked on it took me pretty much all day but i think I have a better understanding of classes now
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
- I have trying to do 10 min breaks every 2 hours. staying focused is a little challenging because I want to help people who may need it so i tend to look at my messages more than I should.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
-continue studying what i have learned so far.
